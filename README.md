## Usage

### Quick Start

Run the main script to start the agent:

```bash
python agentic.py
```

This will initiate the agent using configurations specified within the script files. The agent will begin listening for tasks and execute them as defined by the `task_manager.py`.

### Detailed Functionality

- **Agent Functions (`agent_functions.py`)**:
  - Handles the core functionality including API interactions, data processing, and dynamic task handling.
- **Browser Tools (`browser_tools.py`)**:
  - Provides functions for web scraping, which can be used to fetch data required for tasks.
- **Code Execution Manager (`code_execution_manager.py`)**:
  - Safely executes code snippets in isolation, useful for testing or dynamic code tasks.
- **Crypto Wallet (`crypto_wallet.py`)**:
  - Manages cryptocurrency transactions, which can integrate with tasks needing financial transactions.
- **Voice Tools (`voice_tools.py`)**:
  - Contains utilities for processing voice commands, enhancing interaction via spoken commands.
